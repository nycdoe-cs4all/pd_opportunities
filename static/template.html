<p>During this all day professional development workshop, elementary school teachers will do a deep dive into Scratch, a free block based programming language. With Scratch, users can easily combine media to create and share their own interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art. As young people work on projects in Scratch, they learn many of the 21st century skills that will be critical to success in the future: thinking creatively, communicating clearly, analyzing systematically, using technologies fluently, collaborating effectively, designing iteratively, and learning continuously.</p>
